\cite{Kasdin25} show that dopamine in the brains of young zebra finches acts as 
a learning signal, increasing when they sing closer to their adult song and 
decreasing when they sing further away, effectively guiding their vocal 
development through trial-and-error. This suggests that complex natural 
behaviors, like learning to sing, are shaped by dopamine-driven reinforcement 
learning, similar to how artificial intelligence learns. You can find the 
paper at this link:
\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08729-1}{{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08729-1}.}.

Note they measure dopamine using fibre photometry, changes in the fluorescence
indicate dopamine changes in realtime. Their specific measurement considers 
changes in flourescence in 100-ms windows between 200 and 300 ms from the start 
of singing, averaged across development.

\begin{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% CONDUCT A POWER ANALYSIS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Using the \texttt{pwr} package for \texttt{R} \citep{pwr},
conduct a power analysis. How many observations would the researchers 
need to detect a moderate-to-large effect ($d=0.65$) when using 
$\alpha=0.05$ and default power (0.80) for a two-sided one sample 
$t$ test.

<<size="scriptsize">>=
#Power analysis
pwr.t.test(d=0.65, 
           sig.level=0.05, 
           type="one.sample", 
           alternative = "two.sided", 
           power=0.8)
#n=20.58 - need at least 21 observations
@
 They would need to conduct at least 21 observations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% COLLECT DATA
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Click the link to go to the paper. Find the source data for 
Figure 2. Download the Excel file. Describe what you needed to
do to collect the data for Figure 2(g). Note that you only need the 
\texttt{closer\_vals} and \texttt{further\_vals}. Ensure to 
\texttt{mutate()} the data to get a difference 
(e.g., \texttt{closer\_vals - further\_vals}).

<<size = "scriptsize">>=
#Pulling data from figure 2
fig2_further = read_csv("further_data.csv", col_names = "Further")
fig2_closer = read_csv("closer_data.csv", col_names = "Closer")

#Combining 2 values into a single tibble
fig2_tibble = bind_cols(fig2_further, fig2_closer)

#Mutating a new column to show the difference between columns
fig2_tibble = fig2_tibble |>
  mutate(Difference = Closer-Further)

@
To collect the data, I had to first download the source data from the research paper. I could then save the desired variables as .csv files (further and closer), before combining them all into a single tibble. Generating the difference between further and closer just required using \texttt{mutate()}. With these variables, it would be possible to generate Figure 2(g) - the closer values would be on the left, further values on the right, and the difference would represent the lines between them.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SUMMARIZE DATA
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Summarize the data.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Summarize the further data. Do the data suggest that
   dopamine in the brains of young zebra finches decreases when
   they sing further away?

Yes, the data suggests dopamine decreases when birds sing further away. Figure \ref{plot1} \citep{patchwork, tidyverse} demonstrates that data for birds that sing further is below the baseline, with a recorded mean of $-0.203$.


   \item Summarize the closer data. Do the data suggest that
   dopamine in the brains of young zebra finches increases when
   they sing closer to their adult song?
   
Yes, the data suggests dopamine increases when birds sing further away. Figure \ref{plot1} demonstrates that data for birds that sing further is above the baseline, with a recorded mean of $0.156$.
   
  \item Summarize the paired differences. Do the data suggest
  that there is a difference between dopamine in the brains of
  young zebra finches when they sing further away compared to 
  closer to their adult song?
  
Yes, the data suggests there is a difference between dopamine when the young zebra finches sing further away compared to closer. Fiugre \ref{plot1} highlights that the birds tends to have a higher recorded dopamine when singing closer to the song, with a recorded mean of a $0.359$ difference in dopamine.
  
  \item \textbf{Optional Challenge:} Can you reproduce Figure 2(g)?
  Note that the you can use \texttt{geom\_errorbar()} to plot
  the range created by adding the mean $\pm$ one standard deviation.

\textbf{Note:} Your numbers may vary slightly as they performed some unclear
correction of their $p$-values. I'm waiting to hear back from them via email!
